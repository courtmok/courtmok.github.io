    <h2><b>My Journey to GA</b></h2><h5><i>January 7, 2022</i></h5>

        <p> &emsp; I grew up bouncing around schools and cities. Hong Kong for the first formative twelve years of my life to the suburbs of Pennsylvania to the grand city of Shanghai to the big apple New York City. It seemed like just when I was about to catch my breath we would be packing up, ready to move again. Like most third culture kids I molded myself to fit my new environments and ended up developing an eclectic range of passions and interests. I loved art and math. Sewing and physics. I read classics and fantasy novels and then solved calculus equations to relax.Throughout it all I had a passion for puzzles and problem solving. Entering college, I struggled to find the major that would fit me. I wanted to be everything and anything. I considered Engineering or East Asian Studies or perhaps even Psychology. I wanted to do something meaningful that would just click and fit me perfectly.</p>
       

        <p> &emsp;It was while taking an introduction to Java course where I first fell in love with programming. To me it seemed like the perfect intersection of my interests. It had a heavy focus on math, puzzles, and problem solving, yet there was a creative aspect to coding that required flexible thinking and innovative solutions. As someone who had grown up trilingual, I attacked Java with the same zeal I used to approach verbal languages. I went to every office hour desperate to soak up as much knowledge as I could. I was baffled by strings and characters. I knew that the main function meant something, but had no idea what exactly it did. It was my first semester but I was meticulous about commenting my code and needed everything to be as efficient as possible. Learning about functions opened a whole new world for me. By the end of my first year I had already decided that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I was addicted to the feeling of running my code and having it execute just the way I wanted.  </p>

        <p>&emsp;In sophomore year my coding language repertoire had grown. I had learned Java and a bit of C and C++ in class. In my own time I taught myself HTML, CSS and Python. I had taken interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and already decided that my focus was going to be in Intelligent Systems. I adored the versatility of Python and how with just a few lines of code you could build a basic predictive model. You could solve impossible sudokus and play 2048. Yet it seemed like we never went past just building basic models. I learned about and dabbled with KNN and RNN models, handed in assignment after assignment and then simply moved on to the next topic. There was never any emphasis on what these models could be used for, just what they were. I was cramming my brain with information and it felt like I had nowhere to put it. In senior year I took an introductory Data Visualization course - in JavaScript - as a graduation requirement. This was where I first learned about the power of visualizing and communicating your data. At this point I hadn’t linked the models I was building for my Intelligent Systems courses and the potential for visualizations yet, but I was realizing that there was a new, artistic aspect to coding that I hadn’t seen before. For the first time I worked collaboratively to build data stories that were compelling and informative, and to this day I am still proud our or final project dissecting the distribution of suicides on Japan’s train lines. </p>
        
        <p>&emsp;I graduated in the summer of 2020 as part of the first class to graduate during Covid-19. Shortly after, I got my first job at a small communications company in New Jersey. There were fewer than 20 employees, and I found myself too busy helping out with the odds and ends of the company to focus on coding. There were only a few people who coded working there, all of whom mainly focused on coding for servers and products. As someone who had focused on Python and Java, just looking at their HDL code made my head spin. Every so often I would be given a coding task to complete with little to no supervision, with just the expectation I would get it done. I scraped websites with JavaScript, wrote short bash scripts to streamline operations, and would do little bits of data cleaning here and there with Python. Nearing the end of my time with that company, I was given the task of organizing the inventory into a new online system from the ground up. It was here that I shifted into a heavy focus on project management and data cleaning. I met with engineers to create the organization system, and wrote scripts that would clean and sort excel files into the software’s accepted format. I spoke to the non-technical people who would have to use this finished product to see exactly how technical my end result could be. By the end I had a product that could be used by the non-coders and a new sense of accomplishment. It was then that I realized how much I loved working with data and how unsatisfied I was with what I was doing. Doing some research, I discovered the role of a data scientist. It was everything I loved about programming encompassed in one title. The wonder and magic of building working models, the artistic aspect of creating visualizations, and the ability to communicate with a technical and non-technical audience. That day I decided that I wanted to focus on working with data, and applied for the Data Science program with GA. </p>
        <p>&emsp;With this course, I hope to develop myself into a Data Scientist. I want to use all of my past experiences to bring myself into a field I truly enjoy. I want to use data to build meaningful models, create innovative visualizations, and make a long-lasting impact in my field. I hope to invest my time and energy into a company and do good work that I can be proud of. I have already begun calling myself a Data Scientist, but someday I hope to truly earn that title, and be able to call myself a Data Scientist with pride. </p>
